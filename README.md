## Source Code
First, download and unzip the source code. You will need an installation of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, and the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library. Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install Python packages easily. The [GameSession.py](data/GameSession.py) file is where the flow of the program is controlled.  

## Executable
To get started with the FlappyPy build, download a .zip file from the versions tab, unzip it, and run the FlappyPy.exe file. Do not remove this executable from the folder or it will not run.
